    <h2>What’s the big dill with this soup?</h2>
    <p>First of all, we believe dill is one of the most underrated flavors of all time. Pickles have their place, of course, but this herb also offers a natural citrus-like flavor with grassy undertones that shine when paired with a variety of flavors. The herb abounds in this lemony soup with tender poached chicken, celery, carrots, and toasted pearl couscous. Everything’s swirled with crème fraîche for a creamy-dreamy texture, then topped with our fave feathery herb that’s sure to turn you #TeamDill once and for all!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10oz Chicken Cutlets</li>
            <li>2.5oz Celery</li>
            <li>2 unit Scallions</li>
            <li>1/4oz Dill</li>
            <li>3 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
            <li>3oz Carrot</li>
            <li>1 clove Garlic</li>
            <li>1 unit Lemon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Israeli Couscous</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon Creme Fraiche</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cooking oil</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken* in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Cover and bring to a boil; cook until mostly cooked through, 5-8 minutes (it’ll finish cooking later). • Turn off heat. Drain and transfer chicken to a cutting board; wipe out pot.</li>
            <li>While chicken cooks, wash and dry produce. • Peel, trim, and halve carrot lengthwise; thinly slice into half-moons. Halve celery lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon. Pick and finely chop fronds from dill.</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in pot used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add carrot, celery, a big pinch of salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are lightly browned and slightly softened, 3-5 minutes. • Add garlic and scallion whites; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in 3½ cups of water (6 cups for 4 servings), couscous, and stock concentrates, scraping any browned bits from bottom of pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat to a low simmer. Cook, covered, until couscous is tender, 7-9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is cool enough to handle, using two forks, shred into bite-size pieces. Return chicken to pot with couscous (add chicken even if couscous is not done) until chicken is cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Remove pot from heat. • Stir in scallion greens, crème fraîche, lemon zest, and juice from half the lemon (whole lemon for 4 servings). Season generously with salt (start with 1 tsp, then taste and add more from there if desired) and pepper.</li>
            <li>Divide soup between bowls; squeeze juice from remaining lemon over top and garnish with dill. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
